It looks like you're still encountering warnings related to deprecated packages and unmet peer dependencies even after attempting to clean and reinstall your project's dependencies. These warnings can be challenging to resolve, especially when dealing with a complex package ecosystem.

Since the warnings involve various packages and dependencies, here's what you can consider doing next:

Review Deprecated Packages: Take note of the packages that are being flagged as deprecated. Deprecated packages are no longer actively maintained and can potentially cause issues in your project. Look for alternative packages that offer similar functionality and are actively maintained.

Resolve Peer Dependency Warnings: Address the unmet peer dependency warnings by ensuring that the required versions of peer dependencies are correctly installed. You may need to update or downgrade certain packages to achieve compatibility.

Check Package Versions: Go through your project's package.json file and make sure that the versions of key dependencies like React, React DOM, and others are specified correctly. Double-check their compatibility with each other.

Consider Simplifying Dependencies: If possible, try simplifying your project's dependencies by removing unnecessary packages. This might help reduce conflicts and compatibility issues.

Consult Documentation and Communities: Check the documentation for the packages you're using, as well as any GitHub repositories or community forums associated with those packages. Others might have encountered similar issues and could provide insights or workarounds.

Try a Different Setup: If you continue to face difficulties, consider trying a different setup or approach that involves using alternative packages. Sometimes, a fresh start with different dependencies can lead to a smoother development experience.

Update Node.js: Make sure you're using a recent and stable version of Node.js. Newer versions often come with improvements and bug fixes that can help with package management.

Seek Professional Help: If your project is critical and you're unable to resolve the issues on your own, consider seeking help from experienced developers or consultants who have expertise in working with complex package ecosystems.

Remember that package management and compatibility issues can be quite complex, and there might not always be a straightforward solution. It's important to be patient and persistent in troubleshooting, and to keep an eye on the community discussions for any updates or solutions related to the specific warnings you're encountering.
